## Introduction

There are many different types of SVMs in this repository. see code in https://gitee.com/zhangjiaqi957/many-svms/tree/master

**why I created this project ?**

Many papers about SVMs do not have open source code, but we need their SVMs for comparison. Hence the `many SVMs` was born.
