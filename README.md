## Introduction

There are many different types of SVMs in this repository. 

## Organization structure

<div align=center><img src = man\figures\manysvms.svg width="100%"></div>

## Why I created this project ?

In order to learn `SVMs` better, I built this repository to implement support vector machines. The package is under active development.

## How to install manysvms

Make sure you have installed `devtools`, if you don't have `devtools` installed, please run the following command first 
```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
```
After you installed `devtools`, remember to instal `RTools`. You can find suitable `RTools` on the website https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. ï¼ˆon Mac OSX you should install suitable `clang` and `gfortran`, see more: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/ and https://mac.r-project.org/tools/ï¼‰
After above steps, please run the following command :
```{r}
devtools::install_github("define957/manysvms")
```
Then you can have `manysvms` package on your PCã€‚
## Important notice
This project is currently being redesigned !!! ðŸ”§
The old version of the function will be deprecated in the new version !!!
